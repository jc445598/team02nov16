    <h2>Making Futures</h2>
		<p>Here at Make A Future,we strive together as a team to help those with less amenities and priveleges with a ray of hope and strength.
        We believe in making lives better by improving future of those children in need.<br>
        <br>
        Early childhood is a particularly crucial time in a child’s mental, emotional and educational development. All children need support to feel safe and secure.<br>
<br>
        But this isn’t always the case and that is why your donation is needed.<br>
<br>
        Some families find it difficult to provide a stable and nurturing environment in which children can thrive with homelessness and disadvantage negatively affecting the children health,        well being and education.<br>
        <br>
        To overcome these challenges we work with the existing strengths of children, their families, and communities to help and support children so they have every opportunity thrive.

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>With Make A Future, we know that giving is about more than just money.<br>
         Thats why our platform enables you to give to charity in just about any way you want to and see the difference your time, effort, voice and money are making inside your account on         your personal Giving Footprint.
         We work hard to protect children from harm and help them access quality education and health services.<br>

With more than 90 years working with children, we are at the forefront of saving children's lives when disasters strike and create lasting change for children and their families through our long-term development programs.<br>
<br>

We have programs in 31 countries, including Australia, where we work in every state and the Northern Territory. <br>

<br>
With the generosity of more than 120,000 Australians, we support millions of the hardest-to-reach and most vulnerable children and young people around the world.<br>

<br>

Our work around the globe:<br>

<br>

As one of 30 member organisations that form part of the Save the Children Association, we share a global vision and strategy for creating better lives for children worldwide. The member organisations created Save the Children International in 2010 to improve the impact of our global programming. <br>
<br>

Our international programs - except for those in the Pacific - are implemented through Save the Children International. Together, in 2015 we reached more than 62 million children in 123 countries.
