        MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO A CHILD STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE

Make A Future primarily works towards creating a bright future for the children who come from down-trodden parts of the society and are underprivileged. We help in giving them a ray of  possible hope and strength that can enlighten their world with happiness by asking for donation.
Many of the children we reach through Make A Future are in treacherous situations, trapped in violent conflict zones or in the aftermath of disasters. They have been forced to flee their homes and have become child refugees. Too many of them are completely alone – and they desperately need shelter and protection, medical care, nutritious food, clean water and a better future, through education.

The help these children need is immediate but also must be sustained to make a lasting difference. That’s why Make A Future donors have such an incredible impact for children – your monthly gifts enable effective, long – term program planning and support which is so vital.

        <li><font style="color:black;"><b> Dancing fuctions </b></font></li><br>
        <p>
        The dancing function can be organised for orphan children that can be really helpful for them making their future bright and colourful as well as sometimes they may be more talanted in that .</p>
			<li><font style="color:black;"><b>Painting competition </b></font></li><br>
            <p>Have the children draw a picture with crayons, then paint over the picture with dye (or watered down paint). Crayons are resistant to dye, so if you draw a picture using a white crayon, they children can think you have not drawn anything, until you paint over it with dye and then they will see the picture. </p>
            <li><font style="color:black;"><b>MASKS </b></font></li><br>
            <p>Cut out funny faces or animal shaped masks from cardboard for the children to decorate. You can use string or elastic to enable your students to wear the masks, or tape an ice block stick at the chin of the mask so the children can hold them. The masks can then be used for pretend play activities, as well as in sing-alongs or storytelling. </p>
